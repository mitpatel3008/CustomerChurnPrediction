üß† Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. By analyzing customer demographics and service usage data, the model helps identify users likely to leave the service, supporting retention strategies and revenue protection.

‚∏ª

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset includes 7,032 telecom customer records with features such as demographics, tenure, service plans, and billing information.
Each record is labeled as:
	‚Ä¢	1 ‚Üí Churned (customer left the service)
	‚Ä¢	0 ‚Üí Retained (customer stayed active)

Dataset Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
	1.	Data Preprocessing
	‚Ä¢	Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables via One-Hot Encoding.
	‚Ä¢	Scaled numerical features using MinMaxScaler for faster gradient convergence.
	2.	Model Development
	‚Ä¢	Built a Sequential DNN with 3 hidden layers (150 neurons each) using ReLU activation.
	‚Ä¢	Applied Dropout (28%) and EarlyStopping callbacks to reduce overfitting.
	3.	Training and Evaluation
	‚Ä¢	Split data using an 80-20 ratio with train_test_split.
	‚Ä¢	Achieved 78% accuracy, 78% precision for non-churn, and 69% precision for churn predictions.

üìä Results
	‚Ä¢	Achieved 78% overall accuracy with balanced precision and recall across classes.
	‚Ä¢	The model demonstrated consistent performance on unseen data and helped highlight key churn indicators.

üöÄ Future Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Keras Tuner.
	‚Ä¢	Experiment with XGBoost or ensemble models for higher accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	Deploy the model with a Flask dashboard for interactive prediction.
